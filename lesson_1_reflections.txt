Resetting to an old version if the new one doesn't work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Auto save prevents user errors. And manual allows smarter commit points.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
THey are dependend on the use case scenario. When user input sggest single file editing, software is
developed to fit those needs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Allowing going back to previous versions and find bugs makes you more confident trying something out
