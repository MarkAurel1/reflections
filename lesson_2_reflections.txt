What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It groups a folder to a git repository with the .git file. It needs to be done before being able to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only contains files that are flagged for commit. It lets us separate which files should be commited, which are chosen based
on their logical connections (e.g. in programming).
