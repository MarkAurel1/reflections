What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It groups a folder to a git repository with the .git file. It needs to be done before being able to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only contains files that are flagged for commit. It lets us separate which files should be commited, which are chosen based
on their logical connections (e.g. in programming).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By chosing to add files that have been logically connected and changed to the staging area and commit them then

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Trying out a extremely experimental/complicated feature, where the programmer does not know if it may work. Another Language version.
They help because you may always go back to a working version of the code during experimental phase

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They show the node points (merge) very well
